# RENDER DEPLOYMENT STATUS CHECK
# Last Updated: 2025-10-24 02:25 KST
# 
# Expected Behavior After Deployment:
# 1. /api/v1/stations-test-new should return success message
# 2. /api/v1/stations should use correct KEPCO URL: /EVchargeManage.do  
# 3. Logs should show "ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ NEW CODE CONFIRMED RUNNING"
#
# Current Status: 
# - Git repo updated to latest commit d25e16b
# - Render still serving old code
# - Need to trigger fresh deployment
