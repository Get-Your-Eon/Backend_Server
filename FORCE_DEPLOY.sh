# FORCE RENDER DEPLOYMENT - TIMESTAMP: 2025-10-24-02:03
# 
# This file exists solely to trigger a fresh deployment on Render
# 
# ISSUE: Render is still running old code despite multiple pushes
# EXPECTED: New KEPCO API implementation with correct URL structure
#
# OLD (wrong): /ws/chargePoint/curChargePoint?api_key=...
# NEW (correct): /EVchargeManage.do?addr=...&apiKey=...&returnType=json
#
# LOCAL TEST: Works correctly
# RENDER: Still using old cached version
#
# This deployment should resolve the caching issue.
